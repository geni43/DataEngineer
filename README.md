# ICA
Objective : Build a classifier with iterative classification algorithm to identify the new label for an item based on its neighbor.
Data : List of documents with domain label and its citations 

Build a classifier to identify domain label for test data 

Improvement : Classifying the documents using Iterative classification Algorithm helps to identify the accurate label.
Main approach of this problem is to utilize the predicted neighbor in one iteration for better accuracy.
